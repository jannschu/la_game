/*
 * THE PLAN:

0.) increase count variable
1.) get all possible L and N positions
2.) map those to L pieces
3.) create hash and store it somewhere
4.) compare this hash to any hashes so far; if it's equal, stop the current
    branch of execution
5.) if the situation means win, return "win"
6.) if the situation means fail, return "fail"
